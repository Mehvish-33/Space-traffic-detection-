🚀 Space Traffic Detection & Prediction 🚀
Project Overview 🌌
This project aims to predict space traffic density based on various features related to space objects and their activities. The prediction is performed using Ridge Regression to forecast traffic density based on input data such as time, object type, location, and peak time hours. It provides an interactive web application using Streamlit to allow users to input parameters and get real-time predictions.

This application serves as a tool to predict traffic density in space, which could be useful for space agencies, satellite operators, and researchers involved in space exploration, satellite communication, and space station management.

Key Features 🔑
Interactive Web Interface: Users can input data such as time, object type (asteroid, satellite, space station, etc.), and location to predict traffic density.
Predictive Modeling: The model uses Ridge Regression to forecast traffic density, based on historical data.
Data Visualization: The application displays visualizations such as traffic density plots and space-related images.
Customizable Inputs: Users can customize the year, month, day, hour, and more to see the predicted traffic density.

Data & Model 🧑‍💻
The dataset used in this project contains various space traffic parameters such as object types (asteroid, spacecraft, satellite, etc.), time of occurrence, peak hours, and location.
Traffic Density is predicted based on this data to help understand traffic patterns and avoid space collisions.
The model is trained using Ridge Regression and has been tuned to ensure that it provides reliable predictions. The traffic density is categorized based on different features and is represented using graphs.

Visualization 📊
Example Prediction Graph 📈:
The application allows users to visualize predicted traffic density based on the input values like time and object type. The user can select different parameters, and the model will return the predicted traffic density.
Space-Themed Background & Images 🌠:
Interactive Visuals: The app includes space-related images and beautiful visualizations to make the experience more engaging.
Custom Space Images: A space-themed background is used in the UI to create a better user experience.
