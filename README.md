# 🚀 Space Traffic Detection & Prediction 🚀

## Project Overview 🌌

This project aims to predict **space traffic density** based on various features related to space objects and their activities. The prediction is performed using **Ridge Regression** to forecast traffic density based on input data such as time, object type, location, and peak time hours.

It provides an **interactive web application** using **Streamlit**, allowing users to input parameters and get real-time predictions. This application serves as a tool to **predict traffic density in space**, which could be useful for space agencies, satellite operators, and researchers involved in space exploration, satellite communication, and space station management.

## Key Features 🔑

- **Interactive Web Interface**: Users can input data such as **time**, **object type** (asteroid, satellite, space station, etc.), and **location** to predict traffic density.
- **Predictive Modeling**: The model uses **Ridge Regression** to forecast traffic density, based on historical data.
- **Data Visualization**: The application displays visualizations such as **traffic density plots** and **space-related images**.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Users can customize the **year**, **month**, **day**, **hour**, and more to see the predicted traffic density.
